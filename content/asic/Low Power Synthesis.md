# Low Power Synthesis

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Low Power Synthesis is a specialized part of the [[Synthesis|synthesis]] process that optimizes the digital circuit for minimal power consumption while still meeting performance and area targets, primarily by leveraging techniques like multi-voltage design, power gating, and multi-threshold voltage cells.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: As power consumption becomes a dominant design constraint, traditional synthesis flows, which primarily optimize for performance and area, are insufficient. Low Power Synthesis explicitly incorporates power reduction as a primary optimization goal, applying techniques at the gate-level to achieve significant power savings.

*   **Concept**: Low Power Synthesis tools take the RTL (Register Transfer Level) design, power intent (described in [[UPF|Unified Power Format (UPF)]] or CPF), and standard cell libraries (which include cells characterized for different voltage and threshold voltage options) as inputs. They then apply various power-aware optimizations to generate a gate-level netlist that meets the specified power, performance, and area targets.

*   **Key Techniques and Optimizations**:
    1.  **[[Multi-voltage Design|Multi-voltage (MV) Synthesis]]**: This is a cornerstone of low power synthesis. Different parts of the design (voltage islands) operate at different supply voltages. The synthesis tool inserts:
        *   **[[Level Shifters|Level Shifters]]**: To translate signals crossing from a lower voltage domain to a higher voltage domain, or vice-versa.
        *   **[[Isolation Cells|Isolation Cells]]**: To prevent current leakage from a higher voltage domain to a lower voltage domain when the latter is powered down or in a retention state.
    2.  **[[Power Gating|Power Gating]]**: For blocks that can be completely powered down when idle, the synthesis tool inserts:
        *   **Power Switches**: Special cells that can cut off the power supply to a block.
        *   **[[Retention Cells|Retention Cells]]**: Special flip-flops or latches that retain their state even when the main power supply to their domain is cut off, allowing for faster wake-up.
        *   **Isolation Cells**: Also used here to prevent leakage from the powered-down domain.
    3.  **[[Multi-Vt Cells|Multi-Threshold Voltage (Multi-Vt) Optimization]]**: Standard cell libraries provide cells with different threshold voltages (Vt):
        *   **High-Vt (HVT) Cells**: Slower but have significantly lower leakage power. Used on non-critical paths.
        *   **Low-Vt (LVT) Cells**: Faster but have higher leakage power. Used on critical paths to meet timing.
        *   **Standard-Vt (SVT) Cells**: A balance between speed and leakage.
        The synthesis tool strategically selects cells with appropriate Vt to meet timing while minimizing leakage power.
    4.  **[[Clock Gating|Clock Gating Insertion]]**: The synthesis tool identifies opportunities to insert clock gating cells (e.g., integrated clock gating (ICG) cells) to disable the clock to flip-flops when they are not needed, thereby reducing dynamic power.
    5.  **Operand Isolation**: Inserting logic to prevent unnecessary switching activity at the inputs of functional units when their outputs are not being used.
    6.  **Area and Performance Driven Power Optimization**: While optimizing for power, the tool still considers area and performance constraints. It might perform cell sizing, buffer insertion/removal, and logic restructuring with power as a key metric.
    7.  **Activity-Aware Synthesis**: Using activity information (e.g., from VCD or SAIF files) to guide optimizations towards areas with high switching activity.

*   **Inputs to Low Power Synthesis**:
    *   RTL Netlist
    *   [[UPF|Unified Power Format (UPF)]] / CPF (Common Power Format) file: Describes power domains, voltage levels, power gating strategies, and retention requirements.
    *   Standard Cell Libraries: Characterized for different voltages and Vt options.
    *   Timing Constraints (SDC).
    *   Activity Files (optional, for dynamic power optimization).

*   **Outputs of Low Power Synthesis**:
    *   Power-optimized gate-level netlist.
    *   Updated UPF/CPF file (reflecting inserted power management cells).
    *   Timing and power reports.

*   **Tools**: Major synthesis tools (e.g., Synopsys Fusion Compiler, Cadence Genus) have integrated low power synthesis capabilities.
