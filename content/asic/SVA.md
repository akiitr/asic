# SVA (SystemVerilog Assertions)

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) are powerful constructs within [[SystemVerilog]] used to formally specify expected design behavior and properties. They allow designers and verification engineers to check for correct functionality, identify bugs, and improve verification coverage during [[Simulation]] and [[Formal Verification]].

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Purpose**: SVA provides a concise and unambiguous way to describe temporal and structural properties of a design. They are used to:
    *   **Monitor Design Behavior**: Continuously check if the design is behaving as expected throughout simulation.
    *   **Detect Bugs Early**: Flag violations of specified properties, indicating potential design flaws.
    *   **Improve Observability**: Provide visibility into internal design states that might be difficult to observe through traditional testbenches.
    *   **Enhance Verification Coverage**: Complement directed and constrained-random testing by ensuring specific sequences of events or conditions are met.
    *   **Formal Verification**: Can be used by formal verification tools to mathematically prove or disprove properties, ensuring exhaustive verification.

*   **Types of Assertions**:
    1.  **Immediate Assertions**: Similar to `if-else` statements in procedural code, they check a condition at a specific point in time and execute immediately. They are typically used for combinational logic checks or simple sequential checks.
        ```systemverilog
        assert (enable_signal == 1) else $error("Enable signal is low!");
        ```
    2.  **Concurrent Assertions**: These are the most powerful and commonly used type of SVA. They describe properties that span multiple clock cycles and are evaluated continuously throughout simulation. They are built using sequences and properties.

*   **Key SVA Constructs (Concurrent Assertions)**:
    *   **`property`**: Defines a set of temporal relationships between signals or events.
    *   **`sequence`**: Defines a series of events that occur over time.
    *   **`assert property`**: Checks if a property holds true. If it fails, an error is reported.
    *   **`assume property`**: Specifies assumptions about the environment or inputs to the design. Used in formal verification.
    *   **`cover property`**: Checks if a property is ever true. Used for functional coverage.
    *   **Operators**: SVA includes a rich set of temporal operators (e.g., `##` for delay, `s_eventually` for eventually, `s_always` for always, `throughout` for duration) to describe complex timing relationships.

*   **Example of a Concurrent Assertion**: Checking that a request is always followed by an acknowledge within 1 to 5 clock cycles.
    ```systemverilog
    property req_ack_property;
      @(posedge clk) req |-> ##[1:5] ack;
    endproperty

    assert property (req_ack_property) else $error("Request not acknowledged within 5 cycles!");
    ```

*   **Placement of SVA**: Assertions can be written directly within the [[RTL Design|RTL code]] (often in interface or module files) or in separate assertion files that are bound to the design during simulation.

*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Early Bug Detection**: Catches bugs closer to their source.
    *   **Improved Debugging**: Provides clear error messages and waveforms when a property fails.
    *   **Executable Specification**: Assertions serve as a formal, executable specification of design intent.
    *   **Reusability**: Assertions can be reused across different verification environments (simulation, formal).

*   **Tools**: SVA is supported by all major HDL simulators (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, Siemens Questa) and formal verification tools.
