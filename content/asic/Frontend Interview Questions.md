# Frontend Interview Questions

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Frontend interview questions in VLSI typically cover RTL design, functional verification, and synthesis, assessing a candidate's understanding of digital logic, hardware description languages, and design principles.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **RTL Design**:
    *   Explain the difference between [[Verilog]] and [[SystemVerilog]].
    *   Design a synchronous [[Asynchronous FIFOs|FIFO]]. What are the challenges in designing an asynchronous FIFO?
    *   How do you handle [[CDC|Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)]]? Describe different synchronizer types.
    *   What is the difference between [[Blocking vs Non-blocking assignments|blocking and non-blocking assignments]]? When would you use each?
    *   Design a Mealy Machine and a Moore Machine for a given sequence detector. What are their differences?
    *   Explain [[Metastability]] and how to mitigate it.
    *   What is [[Latch Inference]] and how can it be avoided?
    *   Describe the purpose of [[Parameterization]] in RTL design.
    *   What are [[Synthesizable vs Non-synthesizable constructs]] in HDL?

*   **Functional Verification**:
    *   What are the main components of a [[UVM|UVM testbench]]? Explain the role of each.
    *   Explain the difference between [[Functional Coverage]] and [[Code Coverage]]. Why are both important?
    *   What is an [[SVA|assertion]]? Give an example of a property and how it's used.
    *   What is [[Constrained Random Verification (CRV)|Constrained Random Verification]]? How does it improve verification efficiency?
    *   Describe the difference between [[Directed Testing]] and CRV.
    *   What is [[Formal Verification]]? When is it most effective?
    *   Explain the concept of a [[Testbench]] and its components.

*   **Synthesis**:
    *   What happens during [[Logic Optimization|Logic Synthesis]]? What are its goals?
    *   What is a [[WLM|wire load model]]? Why is it inaccurate in advanced nodes?
    *   Explain what a [[critical path]] is and how it's identified.
    *   How can you reduce [[Dynamic Power]] and [[Static Power]] in your RTL code?
    *   Describe the process of [[Technology Mapping]].
    *   What is [[Register Retiming]] and why is it used?
    *   Explain the difference between [[Hierarchical Synthesis]] approaches (top-down, bottom-up, incremental).
    *   What are [[Low Power Synthesis]] techniques and how are they implemented?
