# Register Retiming in VLSI Synthesis

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Register retiming is an [[Optimization Techniques|optimization technique]] used in [[Synthesis]] to improve the performance (clock frequency) of a digital circuit by moving flip-flops (registers) across combinational logic boundaries without changing the overall functionality of the circuit.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: In a pipelined digital circuit, the overall clock period is limited by the longest combinational path between any two flip-flops. Sometimes, one stage might have a significantly longer combinational delay than others, creating a bottleneck. Register retiming aims to balance these delays across pipeline stages.

*   **Concept**: The core idea is to redistribute the combinational logic between registers. By moving a register forward or backward through a combinational block, the combinational delay of the preceding or succeeding stage can be adjusted. This is done while preserving the original input-to-output behavior of the circuit.

*   **How it Works**: 
    *   **Moving a Register Forward**: If a register is moved from the output of a combinational block to its inputs, the combinational delay of that block is effectively shifted to the previous stage. This can reduce the critical path if the previous stage had slack.
    *   **Moving a Register Backward**: If a register is moved from the input of a combinational block to its outputs, the combinational delay of that block is effectively shifted to the next stage. This can reduce the critical path if the current stage is the bottleneck.

*   **Objectives of Retiming**: 
    1.  **Minimize Clock Period**: The primary goal is to reduce the longest combinational path, thereby allowing the circuit to operate at a higher [[Clock Frequency]].
    2.  **Minimize Number of Registers**: In some cases, retiming can also reduce the total number of registers in the circuit, leading to area savings.
    3.  **Minimize Power**: By reducing the number of registers or balancing delays, retiming can sometimes contribute to lower power consumption.

*   **Constraints and Considerations**: 
    *   **Functional Equivalence**: Retiming algorithms must guarantee that the retimed circuit has the exact same functionality as the original circuit.
    *   **Initial State**: The initial state of the registers must be correctly handled during retiming.
    *   **Asynchronous Paths**: Retiming typically applies only to synchronous paths. Asynchronous paths (e.g., resets) need special handling.
    *   **I/O Delays**: Retiming can affect the input-to-output delays of the circuit, which must be within specified constraints.
    *   **Clock Gating**: Retiming can interact with clock gating logic, and care must be taken to preserve power-saving benefits.

*   **Tools**: Register retiming is a standard feature in modern logic synthesis tools (e.g., Synopsys Design Compiler, Cadence Genus).
