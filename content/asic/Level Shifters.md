# Level Shifters

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Level shifters are special digital circuits used in VLSI to translate a signal from one voltage domain to another, enabling communication between different parts of a chip operating at different supply voltages, which is crucial for [[Low Power Design|low power design]].

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: In modern [[Low Power Design|low power ASIC designs]], it's common to have different parts of the chip (voltage domains) operating at different supply voltages to optimize power consumption. For example, a high-performance block might run at a higher voltage, while a less critical block runs at a lower voltage. When a signal needs to pass from a lower voltage domain to a higher voltage domain, or vice-versa, a level shifter is required to ensure proper signal integrity and functionality.

*   **Concept**: A level shifter takes an input signal at one voltage level and produces an output signal at a different voltage level, preserving the logic state (0 or 1). Without a level shifter, a signal from a lower voltage domain might not be recognized correctly as a logic '1' in a higher voltage domain, or a signal from a higher voltage domain might damage transistors in a lower voltage domain.

*   **Types of Level Shifters**:
    1.  **Low-to-High Level Shifter**: Used when a signal needs to go from a lower voltage domain (e.g., 0.8V) to a higher voltage domain (e.g., 1.2V). These are more critical because a low-voltage '1' might be interpreted as a '0' in the higher voltage domain if not properly shifted.
        *   **Common Implementation**: Typically uses a cross-coupled inverter pair with pull-up transistors connected to the higher voltage supply. This configuration ensures that the low-voltage '1' is correctly amplified to the higher voltage '1'.
    2.  **High-to-Low Level Shifter**: Used when a signal needs to go from a higher voltage domain to a lower voltage domain. These are generally simpler to design, often just requiring a buffer or inverter, as the higher voltage '0' and '1' are usually well within the valid logic levels of the lower voltage domain. However, care must be taken to prevent over-voltage stress on the lower voltage transistors.

*   **Key Considerations for Level Shifters**:
    *   **Speed**: Level shifters introduce additional delay into the signal path, which must be accounted for in [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]].
    *   **Power Consumption**: They consume power, so their design should be optimized for efficiency.
    *   **Area**: They add to the chip area.
    *   **Robustness**: Must be robust against process variations, temperature changes, and noise.
    *   **Directionality**: Some level shifters are unidirectional, while others can be designed to be bidirectional.

*   **Placement in Design Flow**: Level shifters are typically inserted during the [[Synthesis]] or [[Physical Design]] stages, often as part of an automated flow when [[UPF|Unified Power Format (UPF)]] is used to define voltage domains.

*   **Applications**:
    *   **Multi-voltage Designs**: Essential for any chip that employs multiple voltage islands for power optimization.
    *   **Mixed-Signal Designs**: Interfacing digital and analog blocks that operate at different voltage levels.
    *   **I/O Interfaces**: Connecting the chip's core logic to external I/O pads that might operate at different voltage standards.
