# Linting

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Linting in VLSI is the process of statically checking RTL (Register Transfer Level) code for common design errors, coding style violations, and non-synthesizable constructs *before* simulation or synthesis, helping to catch bugs early and improve design quality.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: RTL code, typically written in [[Verilog]], [[VHDL]], or [[SystemVerilog]], can contain various issues that might not be caught by a simple compiler but can lead to functional bugs, synthesis mismatches, or inefficient hardware. Linting provides an automated way to identify these issues early in the design cycle, saving significant time and effort downstream.

*   **Concept**: A linter is a software tool that analyzes source code without executing it. It applies a set of predefined rules to identify potential problems. These rules can cover:
    *   **Syntactic Errors**: Although compilers catch most, linters can find more subtle ones.
    *   **Semantic Errors**: Issues related to the meaning of the code, such as unintended latches, combinational loops, or uninitialized signals.
    *   **Coding Style Violations**: Adherence to a specific coding standard (e.g., naming conventions, indentation, comment density).
    *   **Synthesizability Issues**: Identifying constructs that are not synthesizable or will lead to unexpected hardware (e.g., `#` delays, `initial` blocks in synthesizable code).
    *   **Clock and Reset Issues**: Incorrect clock or reset handling.
    *   **CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) Issues**: Potential [[Metastability]] problems due to improper synchronization.
    *   **DFT (Design for Test) Violations**: Issues that might hinder testability.

*   **Key Aspects**:
    1.  **Static Analysis**: Linting is a static analysis technique, meaning it analyzes the code without running a simulation. This makes it very fast and allows it to cover all possible code paths, unlike simulation which can only cover exercised paths.
    2.  **Rule Sets**: Linters come with extensive, configurable rule sets. Designers can enable or disable specific rules based on their project's coding guidelines and requirements.
    3.  **Early Bug Detection**: Catching bugs during the RTL coding phase is significantly cheaper and faster than finding them during simulation, synthesis, or even post-silicon validation.
    4.  **Improved Code Quality**: Enforces coding standards, making the code more readable, maintainable, and reusable.
    5.  **Predictable Synthesis**: By identifying non-synthesizable constructs or ambiguous code, linting helps ensure that the synthesized netlist will behave as intended and will be efficient.

*   **Common Issues Detected by Linters**:
    *   Unintended [[Latch Inference|latches]].
    *   [[Combinational Loops|Combinational feedback loops]].
    *   Uninitialized signals or registers.
    *   Multiple drivers on a single net.
    *   Missing sensitivity list items in `always` blocks.
    *   Incomplete `case` statements (missing `default`).
    *   Use of `for` loops with non-constant bounds.
    *   Incorrect reset synchronization.
    *   Implicit wire declarations.

*   **Tools**: Popular commercial linting tools include Synopsys SpyGlass, Cadence JasperGold (for formal linting), and Mentor Graphics Questa CDC/RTL Lint. Open-source options like Verilator also provide linting capabilities.

*   **Integration in Design Flow**: Linting is typically performed very early in the [[RTL Design]] phase, often as part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline, to provide immediate feedback to designers.
