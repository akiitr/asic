# Synchronous Reset

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
A synchronous reset is a type of reset signal that is only recognized and applied to sequential elements (like flip-flops) on the active edge of the clock. This ensures that the reset operation is synchronized with the rest of the circuit's clocking scheme.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Contrast with [[Asynchronous Reset in VLSI|Asynchronous Reset]]**: Unlike asynchronous resets, which can assert or deassert at any time independent of the clock, a synchronous reset must be active and stable for a certain duration *before* the active clock edge to be recognized.

*   **How it Works**: In a synchronous reset scheme, the reset signal is typically gated by the clock. This means the reset signal is sampled by the flip-flop only when the clock edge arrives. The reset signal is treated like any other data input to the flip-flop.

*   **HDL Implementation Example (Verilog)**:
    ```verilog
    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
      if (reset) // Synchronous reset
        q <= 1'b0;
      else
        q <= d;
    end
    ```
    In this example, `q` will only be reset to `0` on the positive edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.

*   **Advantages of Synchronous Reset**:
    1.  **Glitch Immunity**: Since the reset is sampled by the clock, it is immune to glitches on the reset line that occur between clock edges. This reduces the risk of unintended resets.
    2.  **Simplified Timing Analysis**: The reset path is treated like a normal data path, simplifying [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]] and ensuring that setup and hold times are met for the reset signal.
    3.  **Predictable Behavior**: All flip-flops reset simultaneously on the same clock edge, leading to a more predictable and controlled reset sequence.
    4.  **Reduced Power Consumption**: Can potentially reduce power consumption compared to asynchronous resets, as the reset signal is not constantly active and only affects flip-flops on the clock edge.
    5.  **Easier CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) Handling**: When a reset signal crosses clock domains, it is generally easier to synchronize a synchronous reset signal than an asynchronous one, as it behaves like a data signal.

*   **Disadvantages of Synchronous Reset**:
    1.  **No Immediate Reset**: The circuit will not reset immediately upon the assertion of the reset signal. It will only reset on the next active clock edge. This can be a problem for critical safety systems or during power-up sequences where an immediate reset is required.
    2.  **Requires Clock**: The clock must be running for the reset to be effective. This can be an issue during power-up or when the clock is temporarily stopped.
    3.  **Wider Reset Pulse**: The reset pulse must be wide enough to be captured by the clock, meaning it must be stable for at least one full clock cycle (or more, depending on the design).

*   **Design Considerations**:
    *   **Reset Deassertion**: For robust designs, it is often recommended to deassert the reset synchronously, even if the assertion is asynchronous. This prevents [[Metastability]] issues when the reset is released.
    *   **Reset Distribution**: The reset signal must be distributed carefully to all sequential elements to avoid [[Clock Skew|skew]] issues on the reset line.
