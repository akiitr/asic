# Power Domains

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Power domains are distinct regions within an ASIC that operate at different supply voltages or can be independently powered on and off. They are a fundamental concept in [[Low Power Design|low power design]] to optimize energy consumption by tailoring power delivery to specific functional blocks.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: In modern complex ASICs, not all functional blocks need to operate at the same voltage or be continuously powered. For example, a high-performance CPU core might require a higher voltage for speed, while a peripheral interface might operate at a lower voltage to save power. Similarly, some blocks might be idle for extended periods and can be completely powered down. Power domains enable this fine-grained control over power consumption.

*   **Concept**: A power domain is a logical and physical grouping of cells and nets that share a common power supply and can be controlled independently. The power intent for these domains is typically described using a [[UPF|Unified Power Format (UPF)]] or CPF (Common Power Format) file, which guides the EDA tools throughout the design flow.

*   **Key Characteristics**:
    1.  **Independent Voltage Supply**: Each power domain can have its own dedicated supply voltage (`V_dd`) and ground (`V_ss`). This allows for voltage scaling, where blocks can operate at lower voltages when high performance is not required, significantly reducing dynamic power (`P_dynamic ‚àù V_dd^2`).
    2.  **Independent Power State**: Blocks within a power domain can be powered on, powered off, or put into a retention state independently of other domains. This enables [[Power Gating|power gating]] for static power reduction.
    3.  **Isolation**: When a power domain is powered down, its outputs must be isolated to prevent floating inputs to other active domains. [[Isolation Cells|Isolation cells]] are inserted at the boundaries to force signals to a known logic state (e.g., 0 or 1).
    4.  **Level Shifting**: When signals cross between domains operating at different voltages, [[Level Shifters|level shifters]] are required to translate the signal voltage levels correctly.
    5.  **Retention**: For domains that are powered down but need to retain their state, [[Retention Cells|retention cells]] (special flip-flops or latches) are used to save and restore the state during power-down and power-up sequences.

*   **Types of Power Domains**:
    *   **Always-On Domain**: Contains critical logic (e.g., power management unit, clock generation) that must remain powered at all times.
    *   **Switchable Domain**: Can be powered on or off based on functional requirements.
    *   **Multi-Voltage Domain**: Operates at a different voltage than the main domain but is always powered.

*   **Power Domain Implementation Flow**:
    1.  **Power Intent Specification**: The designer defines the power domains and their associated rules (voltages, power-down sequences, isolation, retention) in a UPF/CPF file.
    2.  **RTL Design**: RTL is written with power domains in mind, often using power-aware coding styles.
    3.  **[[Synthesis]]**: Power-aware synthesis tools interpret the UPF and insert necessary power management cells (isolation, level shifters, retention, power switches).
    4.  **[[Physical Design]]**: Placement and routing tools respect power domain boundaries, ensure proper power grid connections, and handle the physical placement of power management cells.
    5.  **[[Low Power Verification|Low Power Verification]]**: Extensive verification is performed to ensure functional correctness and power integrity across all power modes and transitions.

*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Significant Power Reduction**: Both dynamic and static power can be drastically reduced.
    *   **Extended Battery Life**: Crucial for mobile and IoT devices.
    *   **Reduced Heat Dissipation**: Leads to simpler packaging and improved reliability.
    *   **Flexible Power Management**: Allows for dynamic power optimization based on workload.

*   **Challenges**:
    *   **Increased Design Complexity**: Managing multiple power domains adds complexity to design, verification, and implementation.
    *   **Area Overhead**: Power management cells (level shifters, isolation, power switches) consume additional area.
    *   **Timing Impact**: Power management cells introduce delays that must be accounted for in [[STA|timing analysis]].
