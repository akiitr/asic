# check_timing Command in STA

## 1. Simple Explanation (Gist)

The `check_timing` command in [[STA|Static Timing Analysis (STA)]] is a crucial preliminary step that identifies potential issues with a design's [[Timing Constraints|timing constraints]] and structural integrity before a detailed timing analysis is performed.

## 2. Detailed Breakdown

The `check_timing` command is used by [[STA Tools|STA tools]] (like Synopsys [[PrimeTime]] or Intel Quartus) to perform a series of checks on the design and its [[Timing Constraints|timing constraints]]. Its primary goal is to flag common problems that could lead to inaccurate or incomplete timing analysis results.

Key checks performed by `check_timing` include:

*   **Clock Definition Issues:**
    *   `no_clock`: Identifies registers or ports that are expected to have a clock but do not have one assigned.
    *   `multiple_clock`: Warns if multiple clock signals are reaching a single register's clock pin, which can lead to ambiguous timing analysis.
    *   `constant_clock`: Flags clock signals that are inadvertently connected to a constant value (e.g., ground or VCC).
    *   `generated_clocks`: Checks for circular definitions or invalid structures within generated clock networks.
    *   `unexpandable_clocks`: Reports if clock periods in related clock domains are not mathematically expandable, which can hinder proper common period calculation.
*   **Input/Output (I/O) Constraint Issues:**
    *   `no_input_delay`: Reports input ports that lack a defined input delay constraint.
    *   `partial_input_delay`: Identifies input ports where only a maximum or minimum input delay is specified, potentially leaving paths unconstrained.
    *   `no_output_delay`: Flags output ports that are missing an output delay constraint.
    *   `no_drive`: Indicates a missing drive constraint on a port.
*   **Design Structure Issues:**
    *   `loops`: Detects [[Combinational Loops|combinational feedback loops]] in the design, which cannot be properly analyzed by [[STA]] and must be broken.
    *   `latch_loops`: Checks for combinational latch loops.
*   **Unconstrained Endpoints:**
    *   `unconstrained_internal_endpoints`: Reports register data pins that are not properly constrained, meaning their timing is not being checked.

The command typically provides a summary of violations, and a `-verbose` option can be used to get detailed information about each problem. Addressing these violations is critical for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of subsequent timing analysis reports.

## 3. Conclusion

The `check_timing` command acts as a vital diagnostic tool in the [[STA|STA flow]], ensuring that the design and its [[Timing Constraints|timing constraints]] are well-defined and free from fundamental issues before proceeding to detailed [[Timing Analysis]]. It helps identify and resolve problems related to clock definitions, I/O constraints, and structural loops, which are essential for achieving [[Timing Closure]].
