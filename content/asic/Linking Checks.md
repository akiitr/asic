# Linking Checks

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Linking checks in Static Timing Analysis (STA) are a set of validations performed to ensure that all necessary design and library files are correctly loaded, consistent, and properly linked together, forming a complete and accurate representation of the design for timing analysis.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: STA tools require a comprehensive set of input files to perform accurate timing analysis. These include the [[Netlist]], [[Timing Library|timing libraries]], [[SPEF|parasitic files]], and [[SDC|design constraints]]. If any of these files are missing, corrupted, or inconsistent, the STA tool cannot perform a reliable analysis, leading to incorrect timing results or tool crashes. Linking checks are a crucial part of the [[Sanity Checks|sanity check]] phase before full timing analysis.

*   **Concept**: Linking checks verify the integrity and connectivity of the various design components and their associated models. They ensure that every instance and net in the design has a corresponding definition and that all references between files are resolved correctly.

*   **Key Aspects and Checks**:
    1.  **Library Loading and Availability**: Verifying that all required [[Timing Library|timing libraries]] (.lib/.db) are successfully loaded and accessible to the STA tool. This includes checking for missing libraries or incorrect paths.
    2.  **Cell/Module Resolution**: Ensuring that every cell instance in the [[Netlist]] (e.g., standard cells, macros, IP blocks) has a corresponding definition in the loaded libraries. Unresolved instances indicate missing library cells or typos in the netlist.
    3.  **Pin Connectivity**: Checking that all pins on cell instances are correctly connected and that there are no floating or unconnected pins. This also includes verifying that power and ground pins are properly tied off.
    4.  **Parasitic File (SPEF) Consistency**: If [[SPEF|SPEF]] files are used, linking checks ensure that the SPEF data (interconnect resistance and capacitance) correctly maps to the nets and pins in the netlist. Mismatches can occur if the netlist or SPEF file is outdated or corrupted.
    5.  **SDC (Design Constraints) Application**: Verifying that the [[SDC|Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC)]] file is correctly parsed and applied to the design. This includes checking for syntax errors, unconstrained paths, or constraints applied to non-existent objects.
    6.  **Clock Definition**: Ensuring that all clocks are properly defined, including their periods, waveforms, and sources. Missing or incorrect clock definitions can lead to unconstrained paths.
    7.  **Hierarchical Consistency**: In hierarchical designs, linking checks ensure that the interfaces between different modules are consistent and that all sub-modules are correctly instantiated and linked.
    8.  **Version Compatibility**: Checking for compatibility issues between different versions of library files or design tools.

*   **Common Issues Detected by Linking Checks**:
    *   Missing library cells.
    *   Unresolved module instances.
    *   Floating input pins or unconnected output pins.
    *   Mismatches between netlist and parasitic data.
    *   Syntax errors in SDC or other input files.
    *   Duplicate definitions of cells or nets.

*   **Importance**: Passing linking checks is a prerequisite for any meaningful STA. They act as a gatekeeper, ensuring that the STA tool has all the necessary and correct information to perform its analysis. Resolving linking issues early in the flow saves significant time and effort compared to debugging incorrect timing results later.
