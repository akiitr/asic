# Tempus

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Cadence Tempus is a leading EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tool used for [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]] and timing sign-off in complex ASIC designs. It helps verify that the chip will operate correctly at its specified speed across various conditions.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Purpose**: Tempus is designed to perform comprehensive static timing analysis on large-scale digital integrated circuits. Its primary functions include:
    *   **Timing Verification**: Ensuring that all timing paths in the design meet the specified performance requirements (e.g., clock frequency, setup/hold times).
    *   **Timing Closure**: Identifying and helping to fix timing violations to achieve design closure.
    *   **Sign-off**: Providing the final timing sign-off for manufacturing, ensuring the chip will function reliably in silicon.

*   **Key Features and Capabilities**:
    1.  **Full-Chip STA**: Capable of analyzing the timing of entire complex System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, including hierarchical designs.
    2.  **Advanced Variation Analysis**: Supports advanced statistical timing analysis (e.g., [[POCV|Parametric OCV]]) and [[OCV|On-Chip Variation]] (OCV) analysis to accurately model and account for process variations across the chip.
    3.  **[[Signal Integrity]] (SI) Analysis**: Integrates signal integrity analysis to account for the impact of [[Crosstalk in VLSI|crosstalk]] and noise on timing, including [[SI Double Switching]] effects.
    4.  **Power-Aware Timing**: Can perform timing analysis considering power management techniques like [[Power Gating|power gating]] and [[Multi-voltage Design|multi-voltage design]], and their impact on timing.
    5.  **ECO (Engineering Change Order) Flow**: Provides capabilities for efficient timing ECOs, allowing designers to quickly fix timing violations by making localized changes without a full re-layout.
    6.  **Multi-Mode Multi-Corner (MMMC) Analysis**: Analyzes the design across multiple operating modes (e.g., functional, test) and various [[PVT Corners]] (Process, Voltage, Temperature) to ensure robust timing closure.
    7.  **Reporting and Debugging**: Generates detailed timing reports, including critical path reports, setup/hold violation reports, and provides graphical visualization tools for debugging timing issues.

*   **Inputs**: Similar to other STA tools, Tempus requires:
    *   [[Netlist]] (gate-level)
    *   [[Timing Library|Liberty (.lib)]] files for standard cells and macros
    *   [[SDC|Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC)]] file
    *   [[SPEF|Parasitic files]] (extracted from physical layout)

*   **Integration in Design Flow**: Tempus is typically used after the [[Physical Design]] stage (placement and routing) and before [[Tape Out & Manufacturing|tape-out]]. It is a critical tool for achieving timing closure and sign-off.

*   **Competition**: Tempus competes with other leading STA tools like Synopsys PrimeTime.
