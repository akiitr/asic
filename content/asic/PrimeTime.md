# PrimeTime in VLSI Static Timing Analysis (STA)

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
PrimeTime is a leading commercial tool from Synopsys used for [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]] in VLSI design. It verifies that all timing paths in a chip meet their performance requirements across various operating conditions, ensuring the chip functions correctly at its specified clock frequency.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: As chip designs become more complex and operate at higher frequencies, it's impossible to verify timing through simulation alone. [[STA]] provides a comprehensive and exhaustive analysis of all possible timing paths, ensuring that setup and hold times are met for every flip-flop and that signals propagate within their allocated time budgets.

*   **Concept**: PrimeTime calculates the delays of all logic gates and interconnects based on the technology library, parasitic information, and design constraints. It then identifies the longest (critical) and shortest paths and reports any timing violations.

*   **Key Features and Capabilities**: 
    1.  **Comprehensive Timing Analysis**: Performs exhaustive checks for setup, hold, recovery, removal, and other timing violations across all operating modes and [[PVT Corners|PVT corners]].
    2.  **Accurate Delay Calculation**: Uses advanced delay calculation models (e.g., [[NLDM]], [[CCS]], [[ECSM]]) to accurately model cell and interconnect delays, considering factors like input slew, output load, and process variations.
    3.  **Constraint Validation**: Verifies the correctness and completeness of [[SDC|Synopsys Design Constraints]] (.sdc) files, which define the timing requirements of the design.
    4.  **Path Reporting**: Generates detailed timing reports for critical paths, showing the delay contributions of each cell and net, which is essential for debugging and optimization.
    5.  **Variability Analysis**: Supports advanced variability analysis techniques like [[OCV]], [[AOCV]], and [[POCV]] to account for on-chip variations.
    6.  **Signal Integrity (SI) Analysis**: Can perform [[Signal Integrity]] analysis to identify and mitigate issues like [[Crosstalk Delay]] and [[Noise|crosstalk noise]].
    7.  **Power-Aware Timing Analysis**: Integrates with power analysis tools to perform [[IR Drop Aware Timing Signoff]], considering the impact of voltage drops on timing.
    8.  **ECO Flow Support**: Provides features for analyzing and verifying timing after [[Timing ECO|Engineering Change Orders]], facilitating quick design iterations.

*   **Inputs**: 
    *   **[[Netlist]]**: The gate-level netlist (e.g., Verilog, VHDL) of the design.
    *   **[[Timing Library]]**: Characterized timing information for all standard cells and macros in the technology library (e.g., .lib files).
    *   **[[SDC|Synopsys Design Constraints]]**: The timing constraints for the design (e.g., clock definitions, input/output delays, timing exceptions).
    *   **[[SPEF|Parasitic Files]]**: Extracted parasitic information (resistance and capacitance) of interconnects from the physical layout (e.g., .spef files).
    *   **[[SDF|Standard Delay Format]]**: Can be used to back-annotate delays from physical design tools.

*   **Outputs**: 
    *   Detailed timing reports (e.g., [[report_timing]], [[report_qor]], [[report_clock_timing]]).
    *   Violation reports.
    *   Timing databases for further analysis.

*   **Role in the Design Flow**: PrimeTime is typically used after [[Physical Design]] (placement and routing) to perform final timing signoff. It is the golden timing signoff tool for many ASIC designs.
