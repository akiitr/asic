# Sequential Logic

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Sequential logic is a type of digital circuit whose output depends not only on its current inputs but also on its past inputs (i.e., its current state). This memory characteristic is achieved through feedback paths and storage elements like flip-flops and latches.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Contrast with [[Combinational Logic]]**: Unlike combinational logic, which produces outputs solely based on current inputs, sequential logic incorporates memory elements. This means sequential circuits can store information and their behavior is dependent on a sequence of inputs over time.

*   **Key Components**:
    1.  **Storage Elements**: These are the fundamental building blocks that provide memory to the circuit.
        *   **Latches**: Level-sensitive devices that store a bit of information. Their output can change as long as the enable signal is active.
        *   **Flip-Flops**: Edge-triggered devices that store a bit of information. Their output changes only at a specific edge (rising or falling) of a clock signal. Flip-flops are the most common storage elements in synchronous digital designs.
    2.  **[[Combinational Logic]]**: Used to compute the next state of the storage elements and the primary outputs based on the current state and current inputs.

*   **Types of Sequential Circuits**:
    1.  **Synchronous Sequential Circuits**: The state changes occur only at discrete instants of time, synchronized by a global clock signal. All flip-flops in the circuit are triggered by the same clock edge. This is the predominant type of sequential logic used in modern ASICs due to its predictability and ease of design and analysis.
    2.  **Asynchronous Sequential Circuits**: The state changes can occur at any time, triggered by changes in input signals without a central clock. These circuits are generally more complex to design and verify due to potential race conditions and hazards, and are less commonly used in large-scale digital systems.

*   **Common Sequential Elements**:
    *   **D Flip-Flop**: Stores the value of its D input when clocked.
    *   **JK Flip-Flop**: More versatile, can set, reset, toggle, or hold its state.
    *   **T Flip-Flop**: Toggles its state on each clock pulse if the T input is high.
    *   **SR Latch/Flip-Flop**: Set-Reset latch, one of the simplest storage elements.

*   **Applications of Sequential Logic**:
    *   **Memory**: Registers, counters, shift registers.
    *   **[[Finite State Machines (FSM)|Finite State Machines (FSM)]]**: Control units that sequence operations in a digital system.
    *   **Counters**: Circuits that count events.
    *   **Shift Registers**: Circuits that shift data bits sequentially.
    *   **Microprocessors**: The core of any processor relies heavily on sequential logic for program counters, instruction registers, and general-purpose registers.

*   **Design Considerations**:
    *   **Clocking**: Proper clock distribution and synchronization are critical to avoid [[Clock Skew]] and [[Metastability]] issues.
    *   **Reset**: A robust reset strategy is essential to bring the circuit to a known initial state.
    *   **Timing**: [[Setup]] and [[Hold Time]] constraints must be met for reliable operation of flip-flops.
