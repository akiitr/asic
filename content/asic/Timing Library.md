# Timing Library

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
A timing library, typically in Liberty (.lib) format, is a crucial file in ASIC design that contains all the timing, power, and noise characteristics of the [[Standard Cell Library]] and other IP blocks. It's used by EDA tools to accurately predict and verify the performance of a chip.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Purpose**: The timing library provides the necessary data for EDA tools (like [[Synthesis]] tools, [[Physical Design]] tools, and especially [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]] tools) to calculate delays, analyze power consumption, and ensure the design meets its performance specifications. It captures the behavior of each cell under various operating conditions.

*   **Format**: The most common format for timing libraries is **Liberty (.lib)**, which is an ASCII-based, human-readable format. It is an industry standard developed by Synopsys.

*   **What it Contains**: For each cell in the [[Standard Cell Library]] (e.g., NAND gate, flip-flop, buffer), the timing library specifies:
    1.  **Cell Delays**: How long it takes for a signal to propagate through the cell. This is typically represented using **Non-Linear Delay Models (NLDM)**, **Composite Current Source (CCS)**, or **Effective Current Source Model (ECSM)** tables, which account for variations in input transition time (slew) and output load capacitance.
    2.  **Setup and Hold Times**: The minimum time requirements for data to be stable before and after the clock edge for sequential elements (flip-flops, latches).
    3.  **Output Transition Times (Slew Rates)**: How fast the output signal changes from low to high or high to low.
    4.  **Power Consumption**: Both static (leakage) and dynamic (switching) power consumption for each cell.
    5.  **Noise Characteristics**: Information related to noise propagation and susceptibility, used for [[Signal Integrity]] analysis.
    6.  **Pin Capacitance**: The input capacitance of each pin.
    7.  **Functionality**: A Boolean description of the cell's logic function.
    8.  **Operating Conditions**: The library contains data for multiple [[PVT Corners]] (Process, Voltage, Temperature) to cover the range of expected operating environments.

*   **Generation**: Timing libraries are generated by **cell characterization tools** (e.g., Synopsys SiliconSmart, Cadence Liberate) by simulating the transistor-level behavior of each standard cell across a wide range of input transitions, output loads, and PVT conditions. This process is typically performed by the [[Foundry]] or a specialized library vendor.

*   **Role in the Design Flow**:
    *   **[[Synthesis]]**: Synthesis tools use the timing and power information to select the optimal cells and size them to meet the design's PPA targets.
    *   **[[Physical Design]]**: Placement and routing tools use the timing data to make decisions that minimize delays on critical paths.
    *   **[[STA|Static Timing Analysis]]**: STA tools are the primary consumers of timing libraries. They use the detailed delay models to accurately calculate path delays and verify timing closure across all operating conditions.
    *   **Power Analysis**: Power analysis tools use the power data to estimate and verify the chip's power consumption.

*   **Importance**: The accuracy and completeness of the timing library are paramount. Any inaccuracies can lead to timing violations in silicon, requiring costly re-spins. Therefore, libraries are rigorously characterized and validated.
