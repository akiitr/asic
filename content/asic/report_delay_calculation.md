# report_delay_calculation Command in PrimeTime STA

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
`report_delay_calculation` is a [[PrimeTime]] command used in [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]] to provide a detailed breakdown of how the delay of a specific timing path or segment is calculated, showing contributions from cells, nets, and various timing effects.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: When a timing violation occurs, or when analyzing a critical path, it is essential to understand precisely where the delay comes from. This command helps designers debug timing issues by providing a granular view of the delay components, allowing them to identify bottlenecks and potential areas for optimization.

*   **Concept**: The command takes a specific timing path or a segment of a path and lists the individual delay contributions of each cell (logic gates, flip-flops) and interconnect (wires) along that path. It also accounts for various factors that influence delay, such as input slew, output load, and signal integrity effects.

*   **Key Information Reported**: 
    *   **Path Segment**: The specific portion of the timing path being analyzed.
    *   **Cell Delay**: The delay contributed by each logic cell (e.g., AND gate, inverter, flip-flop). This delay is typically looked up from the [[Timing Library]] based on the input transition time and output load capacitance.
    *   **Net Delay (Interconnect Delay)**: The delay contributed by the interconnect wires between cells. This is calculated from the extracted parasitic resistance and capacitance ([[SPEF|SPEF]] file) of the net.
    *   **Input Slew/Transition Time**: The rise or fall time of the signal at the input of a cell or net. This affects the cell delay.
    *   **Output Load/Capacitance**: The total capacitance driven by a cell's output, which affects its delay.
    *   **Arrival Time**: The time at which the signal arrives at a specific point in the path.
    *   **Required Time**: The time by which the signal must arrive at a specific point to meet timing requirements.
    *   **Slack**: The difference between the required time and the arrival time. A negative slack indicates a timing violation.
    *   **Derating Factors**: Any derating factors applied due to [[OCV|On-Chip Variation]] or other effects.
    *   **Signal Integrity Effects**: Contributions from [[Crosstalk Delay]] or [[Noise]] if SI analysis is enabled.

*   **Importance**: 
    *   **Timing Debugging**: Provides the most detailed information for debugging timing violations, allowing designers to pinpoint the exact source of delay.
    *   **Optimization Guidance**: Helps identify which cells or nets are contributing most to the delay, guiding optimization efforts (e.g., cell sizing, buffer insertion, routing changes).
    *   **Correlation**: Useful for correlating pre-layout and post-layout timing results by comparing detailed delay breakdowns.
    *   **Understanding Design Behavior**: Provides a deeper understanding of how signals propagate through the circuit.

*   **Usage**: 
    *   The command is typically used after running a timing analysis (`update_timing`) in PrimeTime.
    *   It requires specifying the start and end points of the path or segment to be analyzed. This can often be done by selecting a path from a `report_timing` output.

*   **Relationship to Other Commands**: 
    *   Often used after `report_timing` to get more granular details about a specific violating path.
    *   The information from `report_delay_calculation` can inform decisions for [[Timing ECO|timing ECOs]].
