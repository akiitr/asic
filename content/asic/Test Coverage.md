# Test Coverage

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Test coverage is a metric used in ASIC design to measure how thoroughly a design has been verified or tested. It quantifies the extent to which the test suite has exercised the design's functionality or structural elements.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Purpose**: The primary goal of test coverage is to assess the completeness and effectiveness of the verification process. High test coverage indicates a lower probability of design bugs escaping to silicon, leading to higher quality and more reliable chips.

*   **Types of Test Coverage**:
    Test coverage can be broadly categorized into two main types:

    1.  **[[Code Coverage]] (Structural Coverage)**:
        *   **Concept**: Measures which parts of the HDL code (RTL or gate-level netlist) have been exercised during [[Simulation]]. It focuses on the implementation details of the design.
        *   **Metrics**:
            *   **Line Coverage**: Has every executable line of code been executed?
            *   **Statement Coverage**: Has every statement been executed?
            *   **Branch Coverage**: Has every branch (e.g., `if-else`, `case` statements) been taken in both directions?
            *   **Toggle Coverage**: Has every signal in the design toggled from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0?
            *   **FSM Coverage**: Has every state and transition in a [[Finite State Machines (FSM)|Finite State Machine]] been visited?
        *   **Tools**: Code coverage is typically collected by simulators (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, Siemens Questa) and reported by dedicated coverage analysis tools.

    2.  **[[Functional Coverage]] (Specification Coverage)**:
        *   **Concept**: Measures which features or scenarios defined in the design specification have been exercised by the test suite. It focuses on the intended behavior of the design, independent of its implementation.
        *   **Metrics**: Defined by the verification engineer based on the design specification. Examples include:
            *   Covering all valid input combinations.
            *   Exercising all modes of operation.
            *   Hitting specific sequences of events.
            *   Covering corner cases and boundary conditions.
        *   **Implementation**: Often implemented using [[SVA|SystemVerilog Assertions]] `cover property` or `covergroup` constructs within the [[Testbench]].
        *   **Tools**: Collected by simulators and analyzed by functional coverage tools.

    3.  **[[Fault Models|Fault Coverage]] (Test Quality)**:
        *   **Concept**: Measures the percentage of hypothetical manufacturing defects (faults) that a set of test patterns can detect. It assesses the quality of the test patterns generated for manufacturing test.
        *   **Metrics**: Typically based on [[Stuck-at Faults]] (stuck-at-0, stuck-at-1) but can also include [[Transition Faults]] or [[Bridging Faults]].
        *   **Tools**: Calculated by [[ATPG|Automatic Test Pattern Generation]] tools.

*   **Coverage Closure**: The process of iteratively running simulations, analyzing coverage reports, and developing new test cases (directed or [[Constrained Random Verification (CRV)|constrained random]]) until the desired coverage targets are met. This is a critical part of the [[Functional Verification]] sign-off.

*   **Importance**:
    *   **Quality Assurance**: Provides confidence that the design is thoroughly verified and reduces the risk of silicon bugs.
    *   **Efficiency**: Helps identify redundant tests and areas that are not being adequately tested, guiding verification efforts.
    *   **Sign-off**: High test coverage is often a mandatory requirement for design sign-off before [[Tape Out & Manufacturing|tape-out]].
