# Verilog

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Verilog is a widely used [[HDL|Hardware Description Language]] that allows designers to describe digital electronic circuits at various levels of abstraction, from high-level behavioral descriptions to gate-level structures, for [[Simulation]] and [[Synthesis]].

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **What is Verilog?**: Verilog (IEEE 1364) is a textual language used to model electronic systems. It is one of the two dominant HDLs (the other being [[VHDL]]) used in the design and verification of ASICs and FPGAs. It allows designers to describe the functionality and structure of digital circuits in a way that can be understood by both humans and EDA tools.

*   **Levels of Abstraction**:
    1.  **Behavioral Level**: Describes the circuit's behavior using algorithmic constructs similar to programming languages (e.g., `always` blocks, `if-else`, `case` statements). This is the highest level of abstraction and is often used for early design exploration and functional verification.
    2.  **[[RTL Design|Register Transfer Level (RTL)]]**: Describes the flow of data between registers and the combinational logic that processes this data. This is the most common level for [[Synthesis|synthesizable]] designs, as it directly maps to hardware structures.
    3.  **Gate Level**: Describes the circuit as an interconnection of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) and flip-flops. This level is typically the output of the [[Synthesis]] process.
    4.  **Switch Level**: Describes the circuit in terms of transistors (switches). This is the lowest level and is primarily used for detailed simulation and analysis of transistor-level behavior.

*   **Key Constructs and Concepts**:
    *   **Modules**: The basic building block in Verilog, encapsulating a piece of hardware with defined inputs and outputs.
    *   **Ports**: Define the interface of a module (input, output, inout).
    *   **Data Types**: `wire` (for combinational signals), `reg` (for sequential elements or procedural assignments), `integer`, `real`, etc.
    *   **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, bitwise, relational, reduction, concatenation, replication.
    *   **Procedural Blocks**: `always` (for behavioral and RTL descriptions), `initial` (for simulation-only tasks).
    *   **Concurrent Statements**: `assign` (for continuous assignments to `wire`s).
    *   **Blocking (`=`) vs. Non-blocking (`<=`) Assignments**: Crucial for correct modeling of combinational and sequential logic, respectively.
    *   **Parameters**: For creating configurable and reusable modules.

*   **Usage in ASIC Design Flow**:
    *   **[[RTL Design]]**: Verilog is widely used to write the RTL code for the design under test.
    *   **[[Functional Verification]]**: Used to create [[Testbench|testbenches]] for simulating the RTL and gate-level netlists.
    *   **[[Synthesis]]**: Synthesizable Verilog code is translated into a [[Gate-Level Netlist]] by synthesis tools.
    *   **Gate-Level Netlist Representation**: The output of synthesis is often a Verilog netlist.

*   **Limitations (addressed by [[SystemVerilog]])**: While powerful, pure Verilog has limitations, especially for complex verification tasks. These limitations led to the development of [[SystemVerilog]], which extends Verilog with advanced features for both design and verification.
