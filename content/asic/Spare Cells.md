# Spare Cells

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Spare cells are unused standard cells (like inverters, buffers, NAND, NOR gates) intentionally left unplaced or placed but unconnected in an ASIC design. They serve as a reservoir of logic that can be utilized later for [[ECO|Engineering Change Orders]] (ECOs) without requiring a full re-layout.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Purpose**: The primary purpose of including spare cells in an ASIC design is to facilitate post-layout modifications or bug fixes (ECOs) that require minor logic changes. This avoids the need for a costly and time-consuming full re-synthesis and re-layout, especially late in the design cycle.

*   **Why are they needed?**:
    *   **Late-Stage Bug Fixes**: Even after extensive verification, minor functional bugs or timing issues might be discovered late in the design flow or even after tape-out.
    *   **Specification Changes**: Minor changes to the design specification might occur.
    *   **Cost and Time Savings**: Performing an ECO using spare cells is significantly faster and cheaper than a full design iteration, as it often only requires a metal-only mask change.

*   **Types of Spare Cells**: Spare cells typically include a variety of common logic gates and buffers:
    *   Inverters
    *   Buffers
    *   NAND gates
    *   NOR gates
    *   AND gates
    *   OR gates
    *   Flip-flops (less common, but sometimes included for more complex ECOs)

*   **Placement and Connection**:
    *   **Placement**: Spare cells are usually placed in unused areas of the chip, often in rows or clusters, during the [[Placement]] stage. They are typically placed but not connected to any functional logic.
    *   **Connection**: When an ECO is required, the necessary spare cells are identified, and their inputs and outputs are connected to the existing functional logic by modifying the metal layers (routing) of the chip. This is often referred to as a "metal-only ECO."

*   **Design Considerations**:
    *   **Area Overhead**: Including spare cells adds to the overall chip area. The number and type of spare cells are determined based on anticipated ECO needs and acceptable area overhead.
    *   **Power Impact**: Unused spare cells contribute to static (leakage) power consumption. They are often tied off to a known state (e.g., inputs tied to ground or VDD) to minimize leakage.
    *   **Routability**: Sufficient routing resources must be available around spare cells to allow for easy connection during an ECO.
    *   **Timing**: The timing impact of using spare cells for an ECO must be carefully analyzed, as the new connections might affect critical paths.

*   **ECO Flow with Spare Cells**:
    1.  **Identify Change**: Determine the logic modification required.
    2.  **Select Spare Cells**: Choose appropriate spare cells from the available pool.
    3.  **Generate ECO Netlist**: Create a new netlist reflecting the changes, utilizing the spare cells.
    4.  **Implement ECO**: Use physical design tools to modify the metal layers to connect the spare cells and implement the new logic. This is often a [[Metal-Only ECO]].
    5.  **Verify ECO**: Perform [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]], [[Physical Verification]], and [[Formal Verification]] to ensure the ECO is correct and does not introduce new issues.
