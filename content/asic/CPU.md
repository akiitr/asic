The [[CPU|Central Processing Unit (CPU)]] is the primary control and computation engine in a modern [[SoC]]. Instead of designing a [[CPU]] from scratch, teams license pre-designed, pre-verified IP cores (e.g., from Arm or the RISC-V ecosystem). The specification process involves selecting and meticulously configuring a core to precisely fit the application's [[PPA]] requirements.

### Key Configuration Parameters
*   **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: The fundamental programming model.
    *   **Base ISA**: e.g., ARMv8-A or RV64GC (64-bit RISC-V).
    *   **ISA Extensions**: Optional extensions for cryptography, DSP, or vector operations.
*   **[[Microarchitecture]] Configuration**: Tuning the core's internal structure for performance and power.
    *   **[[Pipeline Design|Pipeline Depth]]**: Trading [[Clock Frequency]] for efficiency and hazard complexity.
    *   **[[Cache Coherency|Cache Subsystem]]**: Specifying size, associativity, and line size for L1 I-Cache, L1 D-Cache, and the L2 cache.
    *   **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**: Essential for running operating systems like Linux.
    *   **Floating-Point Unit (FPU)**: Inclusion and performance level (e.g., single/double precision).
    *   **Branch Prediction**: Sophistication of the branch prediction unit.
*   **Interfaces**: The bus protocol (e.g., AMBA AXI or CHI) for connecting the [[CPU]] to the rest of the [[SoC]].
*   **Custom Extensibility**: For ISAs like RISC-V, the specification can define new, application-specific custom instructions to accelerate critical software routines in hardware.

### Application-Specific Optimization
The goal of [[CPU]] specification is to create a semi-custom processor optimized for a specific workload. By profiling the target application's software, the design team can make informed configuration choices.
*   **Example**: For a control-oriented application, the team might specify a core without an FPU and with a small data cache but a large instruction cache, saving significant [[Area]] and [[Power]].
*   This tuning allows the team to find the optimal [[PPA]] point for their specific application, leveraging the flexibility of IP-based design for a faster time-to-market.
