# Routing Layers

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Routing layers are the multiple layers of metal interconnects (wires) and insulating materials built on top of the silicon substrate in a VLSI chip, used to connect the millions of transistors and logic gates together.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Concept**: In a VLSI chip, transistors are fabricated on the silicon substrate. To create complex circuits, these transistors need to be interconnected. This is achieved by building multiple layers of metal wiring separated by insulating dielectric materials. These layers are known as routing layers or metal layers.

*   **Structure**: 
    *   **Silicon Substrate**: The base material where transistors are formed.
    *   **Transistor Layer**: Polysilicon (for gates) and diffusion regions (for source/drain) are formed on the substrate.
    *   **Interconnect Layers**: Above the transistor layer, alternating layers of metal and dielectric are built up. Each metal layer is typically used for routing in a preferred direction (e.g., horizontal on one layer, vertical on the next).
    *   **Vias**: Small vertical connections (holes filled with metal) that connect metal lines on different layers.

*   **Number of Layers**: Modern ASIC designs can have anywhere from 8 to 15 or more metal layers. The number of layers increases with design complexity and technology node scaling.

*   **Characteristics of Layers**: 
    *   **Lower Layers (e.g., Metal1, Metal2)**: 
        *   **Thinner and Denser**: Used for local connections within standard cells and for short, dense routing within blocks.
        *   **Higher Resistance and Capacitance**: Due to their smaller dimensions and closer proximity to other layers.
    *   **Middle Layers (e.g., Metal3-Metal7)**: 
        *   **Intermediate Thickness and Pitch**: Used for block-level routing and intermediate connections.
        *   **Balanced Properties**: Offer a good balance of resistance, capacitance, and routing density.
    *   **Upper Layers (e.g., Metal8, Metal9, Metal10+)**: 
        *   **Thicker and Wider**: Used for global routing, power distribution (e.g., [[Power Mesh]], [[Power Rings]]), and clock distribution.
        *   **Lower Resistance and Capacitance**: Due to their larger dimensions and greater spacing, making them ideal for long, critical signals and power delivery.

*   **Preferred Routing Directions**: To maximize routing efficiency and minimize coupling, each metal layer typically has a preferred routing direction (e.g., horizontal on odd layers, vertical on even layers). Vias are used to change routing direction between layers.

*   **Role in Physical Design**: 
    *   **[[Routing]]**: Routing tools assign nets to specific metal layers and tracks based on their criticality, length, and congestion.
    *   **[[Power Grid]]**: Higher metal layers are extensively used for building the robust power and ground distribution network.
    *   **[[Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)]]**: Clock networks often utilize dedicated, low-resistance upper metal layers to minimize skew and delay.
    *   **[[Signal Integrity]]**: The choice of routing layer and spacing significantly impacts signal integrity, crosstalk, and noise.

*   **Technology File**: The properties of each routing layer (material, thickness, pitch, design rules) are defined in the [[Technology File]] provided by the foundry.
