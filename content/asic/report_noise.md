# report_noise Command in PrimeTime STA

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
`report_noise` is a command in [[PrimeTime]] (Synopsys's [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]] tool) that generates a report on signal integrity issues, specifically focusing on noise (glitches) and [[Crosstalk]] analysis, to ensure the design is robust against electrical noise.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: As technology nodes shrink, interconnects become closer, and operating voltages decrease, digital signals become more susceptible to noise. Noise can cause functional failures (e.g., unintended switching, logic errors) or timing violations. `report_noise` helps identify and quantify these signal integrity issues.

*   **Concept**: The command analyzes the impact of noise sources, primarily crosstalk, on the voltage levels and timing of signals. It identifies potential glitches (unintended pulses) on static nets and analyzes the impact of aggressor nets on victim nets.

*   **Key Information Reported**: 
    1.  **Noise Violations**: 
        *   Lists nets that have noise violations, indicating that the noise amplitude exceeds a predefined threshold.
    2.  **Glitch Analysis**: 
        *   Reports on glitches (unintended voltage spikes or dips) on static nets (nets that are not supposed to switch). These glitches can cause flip-flops to toggle erroneously.
        *   Provides details on the amplitude and width of the glitches.
    3.  **Crosstalk Analysis**: 
        *   Identifies aggressor nets (nets that cause noise) and victim nets (nets that are affected by noise).
        *   Reports the coupling capacitance between aggressor and victim nets.
        *   Quantifies the noise induced on victim nets due to switching activity on aggressor nets.
    4.  **Noise Margin**: 
        *   Reports the noise margin for various nets, indicating how much noise a net can tolerate before causing a functional or timing issue.
    5.  **Impact on Timing**: 
        *   May show how noise affects the delay of signals (e.g., [[Crosstalk Delay]]) and potentially leads to setup or hold violations.

*   **Importance**: 
    *   **Functional Correctness**: Crucial for ensuring the functional correctness of the chip by preventing noise-induced errors.
    *   **Reliability**: Contributes to the overall reliability of the design by mitigating signal integrity issues.
    *   **Debugging**: Provides detailed information for debugging noise-related problems, helping designers identify the problematic nets and take corrective actions.
    *   **Signoff**: Essential for signal integrity signoff, ensuring the design is robust against noise.

*   **Usage**: 
    *   Typically run after parasitic extraction and initial timing analysis in PrimeTime.
    *   Designers use this report to identify and fix noise violations, often by adding shielding, increasing spacing, or resizing buffers.
