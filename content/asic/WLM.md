# WLM (Wire Load Models)

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Wire Load Models (WLM) are statistical estimations used during [[Synthesis]] to predict the resistance and capacitance of interconnects (wires) before the actual physical layout is done. They help the synthesis tool make more accurate timing and power estimations.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Purpose**: During [[Synthesis]], the physical layout of the chip (placement and routing) is not yet known. However, the delays and power consumption of logic gates are heavily influenced by the characteristics of the wires connecting them (their resistance and capacitance). WLMs provide a way to estimate these interconnect parasitics early in the design flow.

*   **How it Works**: WLMs are typically defined in the [[Timing Library]] and are based on statistical data collected from previous designs in the same technology. For a given number of fanouts (the number of gates a net drives) and a given block size, the WLM provides an estimated wire length, which is then translated into estimated resistance and capacitance values.

*   **Key Parameters of a WLM**:
    *   **Fanout**: The number of pins driven by a net.
    *   **Block Size**: The size of the design block (e.g., small, medium, large).
    *   **Estimated Wire Length**: A statistical prediction of how long the wire connecting the fanouts will be.
    *   **Estimated Resistance and Capacitance**: Derived from the estimated wire length and the technology parameters.

*   **Usage in Synthesis**:
    *   **Delay Estimation**: The synthesis tool uses the WLM to estimate the interconnect delays, which are then added to the cell delays to calculate the total path delay. This helps in optimizing the design for timing.
    *   **Power Estimation**: The estimated capacitance is used to calculate the dynamic power consumed by the interconnects.
    *   **Gate Sizing**: The estimated load from the WLM influences the synthesis tool's decision on the size (drive strength) of the logic gates.

*   **Advantages**:
    *   **Early Timing/Power Estimation**: Provides a way to get a rough estimate of timing and power before physical layout.
    *   **Guides Synthesis**: Helps the synthesis tool make better optimization decisions.

*   **Disadvantages and Limitations**:
    *   **Inaccuracy**: The biggest drawback of WLMs is their statistical nature. They are often inaccurate because they cannot precisely predict the actual physical routing. The actual wire lengths and parasitics can vary significantly from the WLM estimates, especially in complex or congested designs.
    *   **Pessimism/Optimism**: WLMs can be overly pessimistic (overestimating delays) or optimistic (underestimating delays), leading to timing closure issues later in the flow.
    *   **Lack of Physical Context**: They do not account for actual placement, routing congestion, or [[Signal Integrity]] effects like [[Crosstalk in VLSI|crosstalk]].

*   **Evolution and Alternatives**: As designs became more complex and technology nodes shrunk, the inaccuracy of WLMs became a major problem. Modern design flows have largely moved away from relying solely on WLMs for accurate timing. Instead, they use:
    *   **[[Physical Synthesis]]**: Integrates physical layout information (e.g., rough placement) into the synthesis process to get more accurate wire load estimates.
    *   **Post-Synthesis Optimization**: Iterative optimization loops between synthesis and physical design tools.
    *   **[[SPEF|Post-layout parasitic extraction]]**: The most accurate method, where actual R and C values are extracted from the final physical layout and used for [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]] and [[Power Signoff|power analysis]].
