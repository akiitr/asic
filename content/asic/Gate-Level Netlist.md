# Gate-Level Netlist in VLSI Synthesis

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
A gate-level netlist is a description of a digital circuit using only logic gates (like AND, OR, NOT, flip-flops) and their interconnections, representing the circuit after synthesis has translated the RTL code.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Definition**: A gate-level netlist is a structural representation of a digital circuit. It lists all the standard cells (logic gates, flip-flops, buffers, inverters) from a specific technology library that are used in the design, along with how these cells are connected to each other.

*   **Creation**: It is the primary output of the [[Synthesis]] stage in the ASIC design flow. The synthesis tool takes the [[RTL Design|RTL (Register Transfer Level)]] code and a [[Standard Cell Library]] as inputs and maps the logical operations described in the RTL to physical gates available in the library.

*   **Components**: The netlist typically includes:
    *   **Instances**: Declarations of each standard cell used (e.g., `AND2X1 U1 (.A(in1), .B(in2), .Y(out));`).
    *   **Nets**: The wires connecting the output of one cell to the input of another.
    *   **Ports**: The primary inputs and outputs of the overall design.

*   **Hierarchy**: Netlists can be flat (all gates listed at the same level) or hierarchical (preserving the module structure from the RTL). Hierarchical netlists are generally preferred for managing complexity in large designs.

*   **Inputs for Physical Design**: The gate-level netlist is a crucial input for the [[Physical Design]] stage. Tools for [[Floorplanning & Power Planning|floorplanning]], [[Placement]], and [[Routing]] operate on this netlist to create the physical layout of the chip.

*   **Verification**: After synthesis, [[LEC|Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC)]] is performed to ensure that the gate-level netlist is functionally equivalent to the original RTL code. This is a critical step to prevent functional bugs from being introduced during synthesis.

*   **Timing Information**: While the netlist primarily describes connectivity, it also implicitly contains timing information through the characteristics of the standard cells (e.g., gate delays, setup/hold times of flip-flops). This information is used by [[STA|Static Timing Analysis (STA)]] tools.

*   **File Formats**: Gate-level netlists are commonly represented in formats like Verilog netlist (`.v`), VHDL netlist (`.vhd`), or EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format).
