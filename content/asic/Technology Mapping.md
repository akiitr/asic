# Technology Mapping

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Technology mapping is a crucial step in [[Synthesis]] where the optimized, technology-independent logical design is transformed into a [[Gate-Level Netlist]] composed of specific gates available in the target [[Standard Cell Library]].

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Purpose**: After the initial logical optimization (where the design is represented using generic Boolean functions), technology mapping takes this optimized netlist and replaces the generic logic with actual physical gates (standard cells) from the chosen [[Standard Cell Library]]. The goal is to find the best combination of library cells to implement the logic while meeting performance, power, and area (PPA) targets.

*   **Inputs**: The main inputs to the technology mapping process are:
    1.  **Technology-Independent Netlist**: The optimized logical representation of the design (often in a format like AIG - And-Inverter Graph).
    2.  **[[Standard Cell Library]]**: The characterization data for all available gates in the target technology, including their logical function, timing characteristics, power consumption, and area.

*   **How it Works**: The technology mapping algorithm typically works by:
    1.  **Pattern Matching**: It compares small sub-circuits (patterns) within the technology-independent netlist against the available cells in the standard cell library.
    2.  **Cost Function Evaluation**: For each possible match, it evaluates a cost function that considers factors like:
        *   **Area**: The physical size of the cells.
        *   **Delay**: The propagation delay through the cells.
        *   **Power**: The static and dynamic power consumption of the cells.
        *   **Fanout**: The number of loads a cell can drive.
        *   **Design Rules**: Adherence to rules like maximum transition time and maximum capacitance.
    3.  **Selection**: It selects the best matching cells based on the cost function and the overall design constraints (from [[SDC|SDC]]). This process is often iterative, with the tool trying different combinations to achieve the optimal result.

*   **Key Considerations**:
    *   **Library Characteristics**: The quality and variety of cells in the standard cell library significantly impact the effectiveness of technology mapping. A rich library with many options allows for better optimization.
    *   **Timing-Driven Mapping**: Modern mappers are highly timing-driven, prioritizing the selection of cells that help meet critical path timing requirements.
    *   **Power-Driven Mapping**: Tools also consider power consumption, selecting lower-power cells where possible without violating timing.
    *   **Area Optimization**: Minimizing the total area occupied by the cells is another key objective.
    *   **Correlation**: The accuracy of the timing and power models in the standard cell library is crucial for good correlation between pre-layout (synthesis) and post-layout (physical design) results.

*   **Impact on Downstream Flow**:
    *   The output of technology mapping is the final [[Gate-Level Netlist]] that will be used for [[Physical Design]] (placement and routing) and [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]].
    *   The quality of technology mapping directly affects the final PPA of the chip.

*   **Tools**: Technology mapping is an integral part of all modern synthesis tools (e.g., Synopsys Design Compiler, Cadence Genus).
