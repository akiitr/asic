# Partitioning

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Partitioning in VLSI physical design is the process of dividing a large, complex chip design into smaller, more manageable sub-blocks or modules. This simplifies the design and implementation process, especially for large ASICs.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: Modern ASICs can contain billions of transistors, making it impractical to design and implement the entire chip as a single flat entity. Partitioning addresses this complexity by breaking down the design into smaller, more manageable pieces, enabling:
    *   **Divide and Conquer**: Simplifies the design process by allowing different teams or individuals to work on different parts of the chip concurrently.
    *   **Tool Scalability**: EDA tools often have limitations on the size of the design they can efficiently handle. Partitioning allows tools to operate on smaller, more tractable blocks.
    *   **Hierarchical Design**: Facilitates a hierarchical design approach, where each sub-block can be designed, verified, and optimized independently before being integrated into the top-level chip.
    *   **IP Reuse**: Enables the integration of pre-designed and pre-verified IP (Intellectual Property) blocks.

*   **Concept**: Partitioning involves grouping related logic and components into distinct physical blocks. The goal is to minimize the number of connections (nets) between these blocks, as inter-block connections are typically longer, consume more power, and are harder to route, potentially impacting timing and signal integrity.

*   **Key Objectives of Partitioning**:
    1.  **Minimize Interconnects (Cut Size)**: The most critical objective. Fewer connections between partitions mean less routing congestion, better timing, and lower power consumption.
    2.  **Balance Block Sizes**: Ensuring that the resulting sub-blocks are of manageable and roughly equal size, which helps in parallelizing the design effort and balancing workload.
    3.  **Meet Timing Constraints**: Grouping critical paths within a single partition to avoid inter-block delays.
    4.  **Facilitate IP Integration**: Creating partitions around pre-existing IP blocks (e.g., memories, processors).
    5.  **Manage Power Domains**: Aligning partitions with [[Power Domains|power domains]] for efficient [[Low Power Design|low power design]].

*   **Types of Partitioning**:
    1.  **Functional Partitioning**: Dividing the design based on its logical functions (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory controller, I/O interfaces). This is typically done early in the design cycle.
    2.  **Structural Partitioning**: Dividing the design based on physical proximity or connectivity, often using automated tools. This is more relevant during the [[Physical Design]] phase.

*   **Partitioning Metrics**:
    *   **Cut Size**: The number of nets crossing partition boundaries.
    *   **Block Area/Size**: The physical dimensions or gate count of each partition.
    *   **Timing Criticality**: How many critical paths cross partition boundaries.

*   **Partitioning Algorithms**: Various algorithms are used, ranging from simple clustering to more complex graph-based algorithms (e.g., Kernighan-Lin, Fiduccia-Mattheyses) that iteratively move components between partitions to minimize cut size.

*   **Impact on Design Flow**: Partitioning is a fundamental step that influences subsequent stages of the physical design flow:
    *   **[[Floorplanning & Power Planning|Floorplanning]]**: The partitioned blocks become the basis for floorplanning, where their relative positions are determined.
    *   **Block-Level Implementation**: Each partition can then undergo its own independent [[Synthesis]], [[Placement]], and [[Routing]] flow.
    *   **Top-Level Integration**: Finally, the optimized sub-blocks are integrated at the top level, and the inter-block connections are routed.

*   **Challenges**: 
    *   **Optimality**: Finding the truly optimal partitioning is an NP-hard problem.
    *   **Iterative Process**: Often requires multiple iterations and manual adjustments to achieve desired results.
    *   **Interface Definition**: Clear definition of interfaces between partitions is crucial.
