# Power Rings in VLSI Power Delivery Network

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Power rings are thick, continuous metal loops that encircle the core logic area of a chip and large [[Macro Placement|macros]], serving as the primary distribution backbone for power (Vdd) and ground (Vss) from the package to the internal [[Power Grid]].

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: Power rings are crucial for ensuring a stable and low-impedance power supply across the entire chip. They act as a robust conduit for current, minimizing [[IR Drop]] and noise, especially for the high current demands of the core logic and large IP blocks.

*   **Concept**: Power rings are typically implemented on the top-most or thickest metal layers (e.g., M8, M9, M10) due to their lower resistance and higher current carrying capability. They form a closed loop, providing multiple paths for current flow and enhancing the reliability of the [[Power Delivery Network (PDN)]].

*   **Key Characteristics**: 
    *   **Low Resistance**: Due to their large width and use of thick metal layers, power rings offer very low resistance, minimizing voltage drops.
    *   **Current Distribution**: They distribute current from the package bumps/pads to the internal [[Power Mesh]] and [[Power Rails]].
    *   **Shielding**: They can also act as a shield, protecting sensitive analog or mixed-signal blocks from noise originating from the digital core.
    *   **Redundancy**: The closed-loop structure provides redundancy, ensuring power delivery even if there are localized defects.

*   **Role in the Power Delivery Network (PDN)**: 
    *   Power rings are the first level of on-chip power distribution from the package. They receive power from the package pins or C4 bumps.
    *   They then feed the internal [[Power Mesh]] through numerous vias and straps, which in turn distributes power to the individual standard cells.
    *   Large macros often have their own dedicated power rings to ensure stable power delivery to these high-power consumption blocks.

    ```

*   **Design Considerations**: 
    *   **Width and Thickness**: Determined by the total current demand of the core logic and macros, and the acceptable IR drop. Wider and thicker rings reduce resistance.
    *   **Placement**: Strategically placed around the core and major macros to minimize the distance to current sinks.
    *   **Via Connections**: Numerous and robust via connections are essential to connect the power rings to the lower metal layers of the power mesh.
    *   **Electromigration**: Power rings must be designed to handle high current densities without suffering from [[Electromigration]] over the chip's lifetime.
    *   **Decoupling Capacitors**: [[Decaps|Decoupling capacitors]] are often placed within or adjacent to the power rings to provide local charge reservoirs and mitigate dynamic IR drop.
