# Floorplanning and Power Planning in VLSI

## 1. Simple Explanation (Gist)
Floorplanning and Power Planning are foundational steps in [[VLSI Physical Design]] that determine the layout and power distribution of a chip, crucial for achieving optimal performance, area, and power efficiency.

## 2. Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Floorplanning
Floorplanning is often considered the "art" of [[Physical Design]] in [[VLSI Design|VLSI]]. It's the initial stage where the overall layout of the chip is defined.

*   **What it is:** It involves strategically determining the location, shape, and size of major components like [[I/O pads]], [[Macro Placement|macros]] (large pre-designed blocks like memories or [[PLL|PLLs]]), and the areas for [[Standard Cells|standard cells]] on the silicon [[Die]].
*   **Why it's critical:** A well-executed floorplan is paramount for the success of an [[ASIC]] (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design. It directly impacts key design aspects such as performance, [[Area Optimization|area optimization]], and [[Power Management Techniques|power management]]. A poor floorplan can lead to issues like [[Routing Congestion|routing congestion]], [[Timing Violations|timing violations]], and excessive [[Power Consumption|power consumption]].
*   **Key Goals:**
    *   Minimize [[Routing Congestion|wiring congestion]], ensuring that all connections can be routed efficiently.
    *   Optimize the [[Placement]] of [[Macro Placement|macros]] and [[Standard Cells|standard cells]] to meet performance targets.
    *   Provide sufficient space and structure for efficient [[Power Distribution|power distribution]].
    *   Optimize the overall chip [[Area]] and [[Delay]].
*   **Inputs:** Common inputs include the [[Netlist|netlist]] (logical description of the circuit), [[Technology File|technology files]] ([[Design Rules|design rules]]), and [[Timing Library|timing libraries]].
*   **Considerations:** Designers consider factors like the chip's [[Aspect Ratio|aspect ratio]] (width to height), [[Core Utilization|core utilization]] (how much area is occupied by logic), and clearance between components.

### 2. Power Planning
Power Planning is an integral part of the [[Floorplanning]] stage, focusing on designing a robust [[Power Delivery Network (PDN)|power delivery network (PDN)]] across the chip.

*   **What it is:** It involves the strategic creation of the power and ground (VDD and VSS) [[Power Distribution|distribution network]] to ensure that every single component on the chip receives stable and sufficient voltage.
*   **Why it's critical:** With increasing [[Transistor|transistor]] density and faster switching speeds in modern [[VLSI Design|VLSI]] designs, efficient [[Power Delivery|power delivery]] is crucial. Poor [[Power Planning|power planning]] can lead to:
    *   **[[IR Drop]]:** Voltage drop across the power supply lines due to resistance, which can cause functional failures if components don't receive enough voltage.
    *   **[[Electromigration|Electromigration]]:** The gradual displacement of metal atoms in the power lines due to high current density, leading to reliability issues over time.
    *   Excessive heat dissipation.
*   **Key Components of [[Power Delivery Network (PDN)|PDN]]:**
    *   **Power Pads:** Interface between the chip and external power supply.
    *   **[[Power Rings|Power Rings]]:** VDD and VSS rings formed around the core and [[Macro Placement|macros]], distributing power from the [[I/O pads]] inwards.
    *   **[[Power Straps|Power Straps]]/Trunks:** Horizontal and vertical metal lines that extend from the [[Power Rings|power rings]] to distribute power to [[Standard Cells|standard cells]] and smaller blocks.
    *   **[[Power Mesh|Power Mesh]]:** A grid-like structure formed by intersecting [[Power Rings|power rings]] and [[Power Straps|straps]], providing a robust and redundant [[Power Delivery|power delivery]] path.
*   **Objective:** The primary objective is to meet the specified [[IR Drop|IR drop]] budget, ensuring voltage integrity across the entire chip. Calculations involve estimating total [[Power Consumption|power consumption]], current, and required widths of power lines. Higher metal layers are often preferred for [[Power Routing|power routing]] due to their lower resistance.

## 3. Conclusion
Floorplanning and Power Planning are interdependent and critical stages in [[VLSI Physical Design]]. Floorplanning lays out the physical architecture of the chip, optimizing for [[Area]], performance, and routability, while Power Planning ensures a stable and efficient power supply to all components, mitigating issues like [[IR Drop|IR drop]] and [[Electromigration|electromigration]]. Together, they form the backbone for a successful and reliable [[Chip Design|chip design]].
