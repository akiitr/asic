# Samsung

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Samsung is a major global technology conglomerate that, in the context of ASICs, operates one of the world's leading semiconductor foundries, providing advanced manufacturing services for chip designers.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Samsung Electronics**: Samsung Electronics is a South Korean multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. It is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones and smartphones, and a major producer of electronic components like batteries, semiconductors, and displays.

*   **Samsung Foundry**: Within Samsung Electronics, Samsung Foundry is a dedicated business unit that specializes in the contract manufacturing of semiconductor products for other companies (fabless semiconductor companies and integrated device manufacturers). It is one of the largest and most advanced foundries globally, competing directly with [[TSMC]].

*   **Key Offerings and Technologies**:
    *   **Advanced Process Nodes**: Samsung Foundry is at the forefront of developing and mass-producing chips on cutting-edge process technologies, including 5nm, 4nm, and 3nm nodes, utilizing technologies like Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors.
    *   **Diverse Applications**: Its manufacturing services cater to a wide range of applications, including mobile processors, high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI) chips, automotive semiconductors, and consumer electronics.
    *   **Design Ecosystem**: Samsung provides a comprehensive design ecosystem, including design kits (PDKs), intellectual property (IP) blocks, and design services, to support its foundry customers.
    *   **Memory Integration**: Leveraging its strength in memory manufacturing (DRAM, NAND flash), Samsung also offers integrated solutions that combine logic and memory on a single package or chip.

*   **Competition**: Samsung Foundry's primary competitor in the advanced foundry market is [[TSMC]]. Both companies are in a continuous race to develop and commercialize the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing processes.

*   **Impact on ASIC Design**: For ASIC designers, Samsung Foundry offers an alternative to TSMC for manufacturing their custom chips, providing access to leading-edge process technologies and potentially different pricing or capacity options. The choice of foundry often depends on specific design requirements, technology availability, cost, and supply chain considerations.
