# Common Power Format (CPF)

## 1. What is CPF?

[[CPF|Common Power Format (CPF)]] is a Tcl-based file format used in [[VLSI Design|VLSI design]] to specify power-saving techniques and power intent early in the design process, ensuring consistent implementation across various design stages and tools. It allows designers to define power-saving strategies such as [[Clock Gating|clock gating]], [[Multi-voltage Design|multi-voltage logic]], and [[Power Gating|power shut-off]] for inactive blocks. The format was initially developed by Cadence Design Systems and later contributed to the Si2 (Silicon Integration Initiative) where it was ratified as a standard.

## 2. Why is CPF important?

In modern [[VLSI Design|VLSI designs]], [[Power Consumption|power consumption]] is a critical concern, especially for mobile and battery-powered devices. Before CPF, specifying [[Low Power Design|low-power techniques]] was often manual, error-prone, and inconsistent across different [[Key EDA Tools|Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools]], requiring the same information to be entered multiple times in various formats. [[CPF]] addresses this by providing a common, automated, and consistent way to specify power-specific data once, which can then be used by all tools throughout the design flow, from logic design to implementation and verification. This helps in detecting potential design problems related to power early in the design stages.

## 3. Key aspects/features of CPF

[[CPF]] allows for the expression of various [[Low Power Design|low-power design]] elements:

*   **[[Power Domains]] and Supplies:** Defines logical and physical power domains and their associated power supplies.
*   **Power Control Logic:** Specifies the insertion and behavior of special cells required for low-power operation, including:
    *   **[[Level Shifters]]:** Needed when signals cross between blocks operating at different supply voltages.
    *   **[[Isolation Cells|Isolation Logic]]:** Used to hold signal values to a known state when coming from a powered-off domain to prevent corruption in active domains.
    *   **[[Retention Cells|State-Retention Logic]]:** Ensures that the state of a block is retained even when it is powered off.
    *   **Switch Logic:** Controls how blocks are switched on and off.
*   **Power Modes:** Defines different operational power states (e.g., standby, sleep) and their transitions.

## 4. How it's used in the VLSI design flow

[[CPF]] is integrated into the entire [[ASIC Design Flow|VLSI design flow]], from front-end to back-end:

*   **Early Design Stages:** Power intent is captured at the [[RTL Design|RTL (Register Transfer Level)]] stage.
*   **[[Synthesis|Logic Synthesis]]:** Tools use [[CPF]] to correctly insert [[Level Shifters|level shifters]] and other power-aware components.
*   **[[Physical Design|Physical Implementation (Place and Route)]]:** Backend tools utilize [[CPF]] to guide the [[Placement|placement]] of [[Power Gating|power gating logic]], [[Isolation Cells|isolation]], and [[Retention Cells|retention cells]].
*   **[[Functional Verification|Verification]]:** [[CPF]] enables power-aware verification, allowing simulators to propagate unknown ('X') values from shut-off domains, mimicking real-life behavior and helping to verify dynamic power sequencing and isolation. This ensures that the design functions correctly under various power conditions.

## 5. CPF vs. UPF

While [[CPF]] is a significant standard, it has a counterpart known as [[UPF|Unified Power Format (UPF)]]. [[UPF]] was proposed as an IEEE standard, primarily driven by companies like Synopsys and Mentor Graphics, whereas [[CPF]] was driven by Cadence and Si2. Although the technical differences between the two formats are relatively minor, they represent competing standards in the industry, with some [[Key EDA Tools|EDA tools]] supporting one, both, or neither.

## 6. Conclusion

[[CPF|Common Power Format (CPF)]] is a crucial standard in [[VLSI Design|VLSI design]] that enables the consistent and automated specification of [[Power Management Techniques|power management strategies]]. By defining power intent early and uniformly, [[CPF]] streamlines the [[Low Power Design|low-power design flow]], from architectural definition to physical implementation and verification, ultimately leading to more power-efficient [[Integrated Circuits|integrated circuits]].
