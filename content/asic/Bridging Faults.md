# Bridging Faults

## 1. What are Bridging Faults?

[[Bridging Faults]] in [[ASIC Design|VLSI]] (Very Large Scale Integration) circuits occur when two or more signal lines that should be isolated are unintentionally shorted together. This typically happens due to manufacturing imperfections, leading to erroneous circuit behavior.

## 2. Causes

These faults commonly arise from manufacturing defects, such as metal debris bridging adjacent wires, or can result from physical damage or degradation over time.

## 3. Types and Behavior

*   **AND Bridging:** When two nets with different logic values are shorted, the resulting value behaves like a permanent logic 0 (AND operation).
*   **OR Bridging:** If two nets with different logic values are shorted, the resulting value behaves like a permanent logic 1 (OR operation).
*   **Dominant Bridging:** In this scenario, one of the shorted lines dictates the logic value, often when a high-impedance net is bridged with a low-impedance net.
*   **Feedback Bridging:** A specific type where the short creates a feedback loop, potentially causing circuit oscillation or latching.
*   **Non-feedback Bridging:** Involves shorts between output lines or input-output lines from different circuits without forming a feedback path.

## 4. Effects

[[Bridging Faults]] can lead to significant issues, including:

*   Logical errors
*   Incorrect outputs
*   Complete circuit failure
*   Variations in signal propagation delays, disrupting circuit synchronization
*   Unintended current leakage or excessive power dissipation, which may lead to thermal problems
*   In some cases, they can even transform a [[Combinational Logic|combinational circuit]] into a [[Sequential Logic|sequential one]].

## 5. Detection Challenges

Detecting [[Bridging Faults]] is often more complex than detecting other [[Fault Models|fault types]], such as [[Stuck-at Faults|stuck-at faults]], and requires more sophisticated test patterns and modeling techniques.

## 6. Conclusion

[[Bridging Faults]] are critical defects in [[ASIC Design|VLSI]] circuits that can severely compromise functionality and reliability. Their diverse manifestations and impacts necessitate specialized testing and modeling approaches to ensure the proper operation of [[Integrated Circuits|integrated circuits]].
