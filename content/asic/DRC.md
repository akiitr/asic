# Design Rule Check (DRC)

## 1. Simple Explanation (Gist)

[[DRC|Design Rule Check (DRC)]] in [[VLSI Design|VLSI]] is a crucial [[Physical Verification|verification]] step that ensures the physical [[Layout]] of an [[Integrated Circuits|integrated circuit]] (IC) adheres to a set of geometric and connectivity rules provided by the [[Semiconductor Manufacturing|semiconductor manufacturer]]. This process is vital for guaranteeing that the chip can be manufactured reliably and will function correctly.

## 2. Detailed Breakdown

### Purpose

[[DRC|DRC's]] main objective is to ensure that a [[Chip Design|chip design]] can be manufactured with an acceptable [[Yield Analysis|yield]] and reliability. Violations of [[Design Rules|design rules]] can lead to manufacturing defects like shorts, opens, or functional failures, increasing production costs and delaying market entry.

### Design Rules

These are geometric constraints specified by [[Semiconductor Foundries|semiconductor foundries]] for a particular manufacturing process. They define minimum dimensions and spacing requirements for various features on different layers of the chip.

*   **Examples of Rules:**
    *   **Minimum Width:** The smallest allowable width for a wire or other feature.
    *   **Minimum Spacing:** The smallest allowable distance between two adjacent features on the same or different layers.
    *   **Enclosure/Overlap:** Rules ensuring one layer properly covers or overlaps another (e.g., contact over diffusion).
    *   **[[Density Checks|Density Rules]]:** Ensuring a certain density of features on a layer, important for processes like Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP).
    *   **[[Transistor|Transistor]] Rules:** Minimum size for [[Transistor|transistor]] components like gates and diffusion regions.
    *   **Via and Contact Rules:** Guidelines for the size and [[Placement]] of connections between different metal layers or between metal and active/polysilicon layers.

### Importance in VLSI Design Flow

[[DRC|DRC]] is a significant part of the [[Physical Verification|physical verification]] sign-off process in the backend of the [[VLSI Design Flow|VLSI design flow]]. It is performed after the [[Layout]] design (e.g., after [[Floorplanning & Power Planning|floor planning]] and [[Placement|place]] & [[Routing|route]]) to catch and correct errors before fabrication.

### Tools

[[Key EDA Tools|Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools]] are extensively used to perform [[DRC|DRC]]. These software tools take the chip [[Layout]] (often in [[GDSII or OASIS|GDSII]] format) and the foundry's rule deck as input, then generate a report of any violations.

*   **Common Commercial Tools:** Calibre (Mentor Graphics), Assura, PVS, Pegasus (Cadence Design Systems), Hercules, IC Validator (Synopsys).
*   Some tools offer "on-the-fly" or "live" [[DRC|DRC]] checks during the [[Layout]] drawing process.

## 3. Conclusion

[[DRC|Design Rule Check (DRC)]] is an indispensable step in [[VLSI Design|Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)]] design, acting as a gatekeeper to ensure that the intricate physical [[Layout]] of an [[Integrated Circuits|integrated circuit]] strictly adheres to the manufacturing process's geometric and electrical specifications. By identifying and rectifying potential fabrication issues early, [[DRC|DRC]] significantly contributes to achieving high [[Yield Analysis|yield]], reliability, and ultimately, the successful production of [[Semiconductor Manufacturing|semiconductor chips]].
