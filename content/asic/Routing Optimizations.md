# Routing Optimizations

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Routing optimizations are techniques used in VLSI physical design to improve the quality of interconnections between logic gates and macros, aiming to meet timing, reduce power, and enhance manufacturability after the initial routing phase.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Motivation**: After the initial [[Global Routing|global]] and [[Detailed Routing|detailed routing]] phases, the design might still have issues related to timing, signal integrity, power, or manufacturability. Routing optimizations are performed iteratively to address these issues and achieve design closure.

*   **Concept**: Routing optimization involves modifying the existing routing paths, adding or removing buffers, resizing wires, and adjusting spacing to meet various design goals. These optimizations are often performed in conjunction with [[STA|Static Timing Analysis]] and [[Physical Verification]] tools.

*   **Key Objectives and Techniques**:
    1.  **Timing-Driven Routing Optimization**: 
        *   **Critical Path Fixing**: Shortening critical paths by re-routing, using wider wires (lower resistance), or inserting buffers/inverters to reduce delay.
        *   **Detouring Non-Critical Paths**: Lengthening non-critical paths to create space for critical paths or to balance clock skew.
        *   **Slew Optimization**: Improving signal transition times (slew) by inserting buffers or resizing wires to reduce [[Propagation Delay|propagation delay]] and improve [[Signal Integrity]].
    2.  **Signal Integrity (SI) Optimization**: 
        *   **[[Crosstalk]] Mitigation**: Increasing spacing between aggressor and victim nets, shielding critical nets with grounded or Vdd lines, or re-routing to minimize parallel run lengths.
        *   **[[Antenna Effect]] Fixing**: Inserting antenna diodes or re-routing to reduce the ratio of metal area to gate area, preventing gate oxide damage during manufacturing.
        *   **Noise Reduction**: Minimizing noise coupling by optimizing routing patterns and using shielding.
    3.  **Power-Driven Routing Optimization**: 
        *   **Dynamic Power Reduction**: Minimizing wire lengths to reduce capacitance, thereby reducing switching power.
        *   **Static Power Reduction**: Optimizing routing to allow for better placement of [[Multi-Vt Cells|multi-Vt cells]] or to facilitate [[Power Gating]].
        *   **[[IR Drop]] Mitigation**: Ensuring robust power and ground routing, using wider power straps, and optimizing via placement to reduce voltage drops.
    4.  **Manufacturability (DFM) Optimization**: 
        *   **Via Optimization**: Adding redundant vias to improve manufacturing yield and reliability.
        *   **Wire Spacing/Width Adjustments**: Modifying wire dimensions to improve manufacturability and reduce susceptibility to process variations.
        *   **[[Metal Fill]]**: Inserting non-functional metal shapes to ensure uniform metal density for better CMP (Chemical Mechanical Planarization) and reduced dishing/erosion.
    5.  **Congestion Relief**: 
        *   **Re-routing**: Finding alternative paths for congested nets.
        *   **Track Assignment**: Optimizing the assignment of nets to routing tracks.
        *   **Layer Promotion**: Moving congested nets to higher metal layers where more routing resources are available.

*   **Tools and Flow**: Routing optimizations are typically performed by specialized modules within physical design tools (e.g., Cadence Innovus, Synopsys ICC2). They are often integrated with timing analysis engines to provide immediate feedback on the impact of optimizations. The process is iterative, with optimizations being applied and then verified until all design rules and performance targets are met.
