# Retention Registers

## Simple Explanation (Gist)
Retention registers are specialized flip-flops or latches used in low-power ASIC designs to retain the state of a register during power-down modes, preventing data loss when a power domain is switched off.

## Detailed Breakdown

*   **Purpose**: In designs employing [[Power Gating]], where certain blocks are powered down to save [[Static Power|leakage power]], retention registers ensure that critical data within these blocks is not lost. Instead of losing the state, the data is transferred to a retention register before power-down and restored upon power-up.

*   **Mechanism**: A retention register typically consists of a master-slave flip-flop and a small, always-on retention latch. When the main power supply to the flip-flop is cut off, the data is transferred to this retention latch, which is powered by an always-on (retention) power supply. When the main power is restored, the data is transferred back from the retention latch to the main flip-flop.

*   **Types**: While the concept is generally applied to flip-flops, retention can also be implemented for latches. The key is the presence of a separate, always-on power domain for the retention element.

*   **Power Domains**: Retention registers are crucial in [[Multi-voltage Design|multi-voltage]] and power-gated designs, where different parts of the chip operate at different voltages or can be independently powered on/off. They act as an interface between the main power domain and the always-on retention power domain.

*   **Design Considerations**:
    *   **Area Overhead**: Retention registers are typically larger than standard flip-flops due to the additional retention latch and control logic.
    *   **Timing**: The save and restore operations introduce additional timing paths that must be carefully analyzed and constrained.
    *   **Control Signals**: Specific control signals (e.g., `save`, `restore`, `power_good`) are required to manage the data transfer to and from the retention latch.
    *   **Always-On Power**: A dedicated, always-on power supply is necessary for the retention latches, which must be robust and stable.

*   **Application**: Commonly used in mobile devices, IoT devices, and other battery-powered applications where minimizing power consumption during standby or idle modes is critical.
